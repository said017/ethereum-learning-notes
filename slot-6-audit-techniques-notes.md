# Audit Techniques & Tools 101

**Goal :**

- Assess & Alert
- Security Posture
- Attack Surface
- Mitigate Risk

**Non-Goal :**

- Security Warranty
- Bug Free
- Best Effort
- Constraints

**Target :**

- Project Teams
- Paying Clients
- Not Project Users
- Technical/Business Goals

**Need :**

- In-house expertise is limited
- Time/effort is limited
- require External review
- Domain Experts

**Types :**

- New/Repeat audit, new for new project to launch, repeat is re-launch or update for new features
- Fix
- Retainer, continuous audit
- Incident, response to incident

**Timeline :**

- Days
- Weeks
- Months

according to requirement and size or complexity of project

********\*\*********Effort :********\*\*********

- Number of auditors
- More than one
- Supplementary/complementary

**Cost :**

- Type/score/nature
- Audit Firm
- Demand/Supply

********\*\*********Pre-reqs:********\*\*********

- Clear Scope, typically specification
- Repository
- Team, for engagement
- Specification
- Documentation
- Threat Model
- Prior Reviews
- Timeline/Effort
- Engagement Mode, for clarification, findings
- Point of Contact

**Limitations :**

- Residual risk, caused by limited time and effort, scope etc.
- not all audits are equal, complexity, effort etc are usually varies.
- Snapshot
- Necessary but not sufficient

******\*\*\*\*******Reports:******\*\*\*\*******

- Scope/Goals/Effort/Timeline/Approach/Tools
- Findings/Classification/Severity/Exploits/Fixes
- Recommendations/Best-practices
- Comprehensive Document

**************\*\***************Classification (by Trail of Bits):**************\*\***************

- Access Control
- Auditing/Logging
- Authentication
- Configuration
- Cryptography
- Data Exposure
- Data Validation
- Denial-of-Service
- Error Reporting
- Patching
- Session Management
- Timing

********\*\*\*\*********Difficulty (OWASP)********\*\*\*\*********

- Low - Vulnerability easy exploited
- Medium - Attackers need in-depth knowledge
- High - Need privileges users and internal info

****\*\*\*\*****Impact (OWASP)****\*\*\*\*****

- High - Causing lock or loss of fund
- Medium - Affect significant but not direct loss of funds
- Low - Anything else

********\*\*********Checklist********\*\*********

- Test - enable actor every compiler warning and test coverage
- Internal Review
- Documentation, specification documentation, how and why, past reviews
- Communicate

**Analysis Techniques**

- Specification
- Documentation
- Testing
- Static Analysis
- Fuzzing
- Symbolic Checking
- Formal Verification
- Manual Analysis

**\*\*\*\***Specification**\*\*\*\***

- Describe the project
- What/why requirement design
- Assets/actors trust
- Provide details and assumptions/shortcomings
- If not exist, more time defining this one

************\*\*************Documentation************\*\*************

- How something is designed without why
- Architect and implementation
- README/Comment
- Assumptions/Shortcomings
- Mismatch documentation vs specification can be assessed

******\*\*******Testing******\*\*******

- Expected Outputs from chosen Inputs
- Unit/functional/integration/E2E/Smoke with high coverage
- Test Cases/Coverage

******************\*\*******************Formal Verification******************\*\*******************

- Compare docs vs specs

**Manual Analysis**

- Business Logic & Application Constraints
- Slow and Expensive
