# My Ethereum Learning Notes

_These repo are meant to be Proof of my knowledge about Ethereum network, Solidity, the development tools and the ecosystem, also as notes and pointer to other resources if needed, structured in a way i think most people and employer think the best way to learn about Ethereum_

- [Ethereum Whitepaper Notes](https://github.com/said017/ethereum-learning-notes/blob/main/01-ethereum-whitepaper-notes.md)
  - Learn about the history of blockchain, the background behind Ethereum, main objective of Ethereum, Blockchain general key concepts (Proof-of-Work, State Transition System, Mining, Merkle Trees). Then go to Ethereum Architecture (Ethereum accounts, messages and transactions for EOA and contract, Ethereum State Transition System, Code execution, Ethereum mining), Appilication that can run on Ethereum. Modified GHOST implementation, the fees design, currency and issuance and scalability problem.
- [Ethereum Yellowpaper Notes](https://github.com/said017/ethereum-learning-notes/blob/main/02-ethereum-yellowpaper-notes.md)

  - Learn about blockchain paradigm (mining, protocols etc.), Blocks, State and Transactions, Transaction Execution, Contract Creation, Message Call, Execution Model, Fee Schedule, Virtual Machine Specification.

- [Mastering Ethereum Book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
  - If you already read whitepaper and yellowpaper, the first three chapter only reviewing knowledge you already have,
  - chapter 4 and 5 teach about cryptography tools used in ethereum, how to derive private & public key, and learn about wallets technology (nondeterministic, deterministic, best practices).
